# benchmark_thesis
Diploma thesis is comparing Edge AI devices in different scenarios. Result of thesis is a universal benchmark framework that includes state-of-the-art scenarios in the form of pretrained models for various deep learning tasks such as image classification, object localization and detection, and semantic segmentation. The framework contains 7 tests on different types of deep learning models such as: MobileNetV2, ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, EfficientDet-lite1, EfficientDet-lite3, DeepLab-EdgeTPU-XS and DeepLab-EdgeTPU-M. The tests are performed on ImageNet, COCO and ADE20K datasets. The framework supports the connection of Raspberry PI 3, Nvidia Jetson Nano, BeagleBone AI, Google Coral USB and Desktop PC devices. The latest available versions of frameworks and deep learning optimizers for the given establishment are used in the work. Metrics such as inference troughput time, latency and metrics such as Top-k or MIoU (Jaccard score) were used for benchmarking. Of the available devices, the Jetson Nano performed best in all tests, such as the ResNet50 scenario with a troughput time of 1221 (FPS) at 10 image batch sizes with a Top-5 accuracy of 0.96% for the 1k ImageNet dataset. From the experiments, we obtained several observations, according to which it is possible to design specific which teachings with their use in practice.
